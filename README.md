## Projects
**1. Heart Disease Prediction Using Random Forest**
![gui random forest](/github/rf.jpg)
- Developed in Python without external machine-learning libraries.
- Implemented the Random Forest algorithm.
- Utilized the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for additional analysis (using a library).
- Employed the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for additional analysis (using a library).
- Implemented a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Streamlit.
- Allowing users to input 13 features from the patient's medical record.
